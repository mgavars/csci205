My name is Mitch Gavars and I am from Chicago, IL. I am currently a student at Bucknell University. I am a member of the Swimming and Diving team and the Vice President of
the Botany Club.

## Overview
This is my lab work for CSCI 205

## Honor Code for CSCI 205
All of my work in CSCI 205 is completed in Java. It represents my own work, and nobody else.
I am committed to upholding the integrity of learning for myself, and for everyone around me. I
understand that when I cheat, it misrepresents what I've actually learned. When I cheat, it takes credit for
the work that other people have completed. It misrepresents what I actually know to prospective
employers. I acknowledge that cheating will have negative consequences on not only my own learning,
but it also minimizes the value of the honest work of others who took the same course.
**Therefore, I will not cheat.**
Work in this course can present complex, challenging problems at times. I am encouraged to research
solutions and hold discussions with my classmates. However, all work that culminated from ideas I
obtained elsewhere is clearly cited in my code. URLs of web sites that gave me ideas are acceptable
citations, but copying code from those sites is strictly forbidden. Conversations with other classmates are
acceptable, and even encouraged when presented with challenging problems. However, code exchange is
also strictly forbidden.
Some labs are designed to be collaborative with another classmate, and are clearly indicated in the
instructions for the lab. In these cases, those people on my team are clearly indicated in every source file,
but each member of the team commits the collaborative work in their labs.
Reiterating, all code I have written is my own, and only my own. I understand that all examples of
plagiarism of any kind will be sent to the Board of Review, risking my failure of the course, a permanent
mark on my Bucknell record, and possible expulsion from the university.
